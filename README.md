# Pokédex

## Yanira Fernández Requena

This is a pokedex I made for an evaluation in the **Adalab front-end course**, module 3: **React**.

This exercise was made in **React**, using **functional components**.

We were given an array whith pokemon data, and we were told to make a pokedex.

I introduced the array in data/pokedex.json.

###Requirements:

1. Create two components: **Pokelist** and **Pokemon**, one for each list.

2. **Bonus:** add CSS styles.
