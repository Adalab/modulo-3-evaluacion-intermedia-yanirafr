# Pokédex

## Yanira Fernández Requena

This is a Pokédex I made for an evaluation in the **Adalab front-end course**, module 3: **React**.

This exercise was made in **React**, using **functional components**.

We were given an array whith pokemon data, and we were told to make a Pokédex.

I introduced the array in data/pokedex.json.

### Requirements:

1. Create two components: **Pokelist** and **Pokemon**, one for each list.

2. **Bonus:** add CSS styles.

3. **Extra: Pokemon Team:**
   - You can click a Pokémon on the list to add it to your team.
   - The team consists of a maximum of 6 Pokémon.
   - You can have more than one of each Pokémon on your team.
   - You can remove a Pokémon from your team by clicking it on your team list.
